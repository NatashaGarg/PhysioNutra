      <h2>What Is Knee Osteoarthritis?</h2>
      <p>Knee OA is a degenerative condition where the cartilage in your knee joint wears down, causing pain, stiffness, and inflammation. Think of your knee as a shock absorber: healthy knees glide smoothly; OA knees act like a rusty hinge that creaks and grinds.</p>

      <h2>Common Symptoms (That Physio Can Help With)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pain with movement</li>
        <li>Morning stiffness that eases with activity</li>
        <li>Swelling and cracking sounds</li>
        <li>Weakness or instability</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="tip"><strong>At-home test:</strong> Try standing from a chair without your hands. Pain/weakness means it's time to move smarter.</div>

      <h2>Why Physiotherapy Works (When Rest Doesn't)</h2>
      <p>The myth: "If it hurts, I should stop moving." But the right movement relieves pain and slows OA. Physio helps you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strengthen supporting muscles (quads, hamstrings, glutes)</li>
        <li>Improve flexibility and reduce stiffness</li>
        <li>Correct movement patterns</li>
        <li>Reduce swelling, boost circulation</li>
        <li>Regain body confidence</li>
      </ul>
