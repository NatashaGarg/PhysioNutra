          Back pain is one of the most common reasons patients seek medical and physiotherapy care. Almost 80% of people experience some form of back pain during their lifetime, making it a prominent condition with significant impact on quality of life and productivity. Physiotherapists play a crucial role in diagnosing, managing, and rehabilitating patients with back pain through targeted therapies and education.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Causes of Back Pain
        </h3>
        <p>
          Back pain can arise from a variety of mechanical, structural, inflammatory, and systemic causes. Understanding these helps physiotherapists individualize treatment.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Mechanical or Structural Causes
        </h4>
        <p>
          These include muscle strains, ligament sprains, herniated or ruptured discs, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis (vertebra slipping out of place), fractures, and congenital abnormalities like scoliosis. Injury from improper lifting or sudden awkward movements frequently leads to these problems. Tight or damaged muscles, referred to as myofascial pain, also contribute to discomfort.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Inflammatory Disorders
        </h4>
        <p>Conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis and other inflammatory arthritides of the spine cause chronic inflammation, resulting in pain and stiffness.</p>
        <h4>Other Medical Conditions</h4>
        <p>Osteoporosis-related fractures, fibromyalgia, kidney infections or stones, endometriosis, spinal infections, and tumors can cause back pain as well.</p>
        <p>Often, more than one factor coexists and interacts to cause chronic back pain</p>
        <h3>The Role of Physiotherapy in Back Pain Management</h3>
        <p>Physiotherapy is a cornerstone in the treatment of back pain, effective both as a standalone therapy and in combination with other interventions such as medication or massage.</p>
        <p>Key physiotherapy approaches include</p>
        <h4>Advice and Early Mobilization</h4>
        <p>Encouraging patients to remain active early on prevents stiffness and supports faster recovery.</p>
        <h4>Manual Therapy</h4>
        <p>Techniques like mobilization and manipulation can restore spinal movement and reduce pain localized to specific areas.</p>
        <h4>Exercise Therapy</h4>
        <p>Strengthening weak muscles, particularly core stabilization exercises, helps support the spine and reduce recurrence. Stretching tight muscles improves flexibility and decreases muscle spasms.</p>
        <h4>Postural and Ergonomic Training</h4>
        <p>Educating patients about correct posture and workplace ergonomics prevents aggravation of back pain and promotes long-term spinal health.</p>
        <h4>Passive Modalities</h4>
        <p>Where active exercise is initially too painful, treatments such as heat/ice therapy, ultrasound, TENS, and iontophoresis can be used to alleviate symptoms</p>
        <h3>Specific Exercises for Back Pain Relief</h3>
        <p>Exercise prescription is individualized but often involves a combination of</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Core strengthening: Pelvic tilts, planks, bird dog, and crunches.</li>
          <li>Lumbar stabilization: Hamstring stretches, squats, lunges, and downward dog.</li>
          <li>Flexibility exercises: Piriformis stretch, hip flexor stretches, and gentle spinal twists.</li>
          <li>Low impact aerobic conditioning: Walking or swimming to improve general fitness without overloading the spine.</li>
        </ul>
